This code is the beginning of a Family Management System for the Pittsburgh Urban Christian School (http://www.pucs.org) in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University.  The mission of PUCS is to provide an excellent education in an urban setting for a racially and economically diverse group of children, preparing students for involvement in an ever diversifying city and the world beyond.  PUCS is committed to educating from a broad Christian perspective with a curriculum characterized by integrated thematic units, close student-teacher interaction and substantive parental involvement.

This is code originally created in July 2010 by the team e-cubed (http://pawn.hss.cmu.edu/~pucsteam) as part of the IS in the Community summer project at Carnegie Mellon University.  This program is a partnership between Carnegie Mellon Information Systems department and select Historically Black Colleges and Universities and is funded by the A. W. Mellon Foundation.  Any questions about this project should be directed to the faculty supervisors: Prof. Larry Heimann at profh@cmu.edu or Prof. Jeria Quesenberry at jquesenberry@cmu.edu.
